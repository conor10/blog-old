I am the founder of [Web3 Labs](https://www.web3labs.com), a blockchain technology company. We work with large organisations to harness the value that blockchain provides for simplifying complex business processes, managing data and their assets.

MEETUPS 🤝

I host the Virtual Enterprise Ethereum Meetup, which happens monthly.  See what's coming up at [here](https://meetup.com/eea-london).

BLOCKCHAIN STANDARDS 🎓

I chaired the standards working group at the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org), responsible for publishing the worlds first Enterprise Ethereum standards. I currently am vice-chair of the Interwork Framework Working Group at the [Interwork Alliance](https://interwork.org), I also serve on the [Baseline Protocol Technical Steering Committee](https://baseline-protocol.org),  and am involved in the Hyperledger Climate Accounting Special Interest Group.

TECHNOLOGY 💾

I authored the blockchain integration library [Web3j](web3labs.com/web3j-sdk), which provides the glue for business applications and Android phones to work with the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) blockchain. The library is nearly 5 years old and approaching 1 million downloads, thanks to the usage by companies like J.P. Morgan, Opera and Samsung.

Happily married with 2 awesome kids.  Blue belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu 🥋 which keeps me sane, I also enjoy running🦶, surfing 🏄 and SUP. Love reading sci-fi 📖 and psychology 🧠, and playing the dungeon master 🧙 in D&D.
